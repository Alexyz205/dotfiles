# Security Review

Perform a security review of the following code, focusing on:

1. Vulnerability Assessment:
   - Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, NoSQL, command, etc.)
   - Authentication and authorization weaknesses
   - Sensitive data exposure
   - Security misconfiguration risks
   - Broken access controls
   - Insecure deserialization
   - Known vulnerable components

2. Clean Architecture Security Considerations:
   - Security boundaries between architectural layers
   - Domain-level validation and sanitization
   - Proper encapsulation of sensitive operations
   - Authentication/authorization across boundaries

3. DevOps Security:
   - Secrets management
   - Dependency vulnerabilities
   - Infrastructure security issues
   - Deployment security concerns
   - Logging of security-relevant information

4. Remediation Recommendations:
   - Prioritized list of security issues
   - Specific code changes to address vulnerabilities
   - Architectural improvements for security
   - Additional security controls needed

Provide specific examples of vulnerable code and recommended fixes.
