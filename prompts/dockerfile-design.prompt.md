# Clean Architecture Docker Container Design

Help me design a Docker container solution that reflects Clean Architecture principles.

## Application Details
- Purpose: [WHAT THE CONTAINER WILL RUN]
- Architecture: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE]
- Dependencies: [CORE DEPENDENCIES]
- Runtime requirements: [SPECIFIC RUNTIME NEEDS]

## Docker Requirements
- Base image preference: [ALPINE/UBUNTU/ETC]
- Multi-stage builds: YES
- Volume mounts needed: [LIST IF ANY]
- Environment configuration: [HOW ENV VARS SHOULD BE USED]

Create a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml (if needed) that:
1. Follows separation of concerns principles
2. Properly isolates configuration from code
3. Builds lean, secure images
4. Maintains architectural boundaries
5. Supports local development and production use cases

Include comments explaining architectural decisions and best practices.
