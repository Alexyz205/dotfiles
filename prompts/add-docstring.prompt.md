# Docstring Generation

Generate comprehensive docstrings for the following code that follow these guidelines:

1. Include clear descriptions of:
   - Purpose of the module/class/function
   - Parameters with types and descriptions
   - Return values with types
   - Exceptions that may be raised
   - Usage examples where appropriate

2. Follow domain-driven design principles:
   - Use ubiquitous language consistent with the domain
   - Document invariants and business rules
   - Clarify architectural boundaries

3. Format:
   - For Python: Google style docstrings
   - For JavaScript/TypeScript: JSDoc format
   - For C#: XML documentation

4. Clean Architecture considerations:
   - For domain entities: document validation rules and business constraints
   - For use cases: document the flow and expected outcomes
   - For interfaces: document the contract without implementation details
   - For infrastructure: document external dependencies and configuration
