# Clean Architecture Automation Script

Help me design a Python/Bash automation script following Clean Architecture principles.

## Automation Requirements
- Task description: [WHAT TASK NEEDS AUTOMATION]
- Inputs: [WHAT INPUTS WILL THE SCRIPT NEED]
- Outputs: [WHAT OUTPUTS SHOULD THE SCRIPT PRODUCE]
- External systems: [WHAT SYSTEMS WILL THE SCRIPT INTERACT WITH]

## Technical Constraints
- Language: [Python/Bash]
- Environment: [WHERE WILL THIS RUN]
- Authentication requirements: [HOW TO AUTHENTICATE TO EXTERNAL SYSTEMS]

Design the script following these Clean Architecture layers:
1. Core domain logic (business rules independent of tools)
2. Use case implementation (application of business rules)
3. External adapters (API clients, filesystem operations, etc.)
4. Main script that wires everything together

Provide code that clearly separates concerns while remaining practical for a script (not over-engineered).
