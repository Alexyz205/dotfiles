# Advanced Prompt Engineering Template

I'll help you create a highly effective prompt tailored to your specific needs. First, I'll ask you structured questions to understand your requirements, then I'll generate a comprehensive prompt template that follows Clean Architecture principles.

## Requirements Gathering

Please provide information about:

1. **Task Type**:
   - Code generation, refactoring, architecture design, debugging, testing, infrastructure setup, etc.

2. **Technical Context**:
   - Which technologies, frameworks, or tools are involved?
   - What infrastructure or cloud services are you working with?

3. **Clean Architecture Layer Focus**:
   - Domain Layer (core business rules, entities)
   - Application Layer (use cases, orchestration)
   - Interface Adapters (controllers, presenters, gateways)
   - Infrastructure (frameworks, drivers, external systems)

4. **Desired Output Format**:
   - Complete solution, step-by-step guide, code snippets, architectural diagram, etc.
   - Do you want explanations with the code?

5. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Performance requirements
   - Security constraints
   - Scaling needs
   - Error handling expectations
   - Testing requirements

## Prompt Creation Process

Based on your answers, I'll create a prompt that:

1. Provides clear context and requirements
2. Follows Clean Architecture principles
3. Includes specific technical constraints
4. Outlines expected deliverables
5. Requests appropriate explanations

The generated prompt will have these sections:
- Task Definition (What needs to be done)
- Technical Context (Relevant systems and technologies)
- Architecture Requirements (Clean Architecture principles to follow)
- Expected Deliverables (Code, diagrams, explanations)
- Evaluation Criteria (How to assess the solution)

I'll help you refine the prompt until it's optimized for your specific needs.
