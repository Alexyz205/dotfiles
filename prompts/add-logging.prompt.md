# Add Contextual Logging

Add appropriate logging to the following code following these guidelines:

1. Logging Levels:
   - ERROR: For exceptions and application failures
   - WARN: For unusual but recoverable situations
   - INFO: For important events in normal operation
   - DEBUG: For detailed diagnostic information

2. Context Information:
   - Include relevant identifiers (request ID, user ID, etc.)
   - Add timestamps where not automatically provided
   - Log entry/exit of critical methods
   - Include relevant state information

3. Clean Architecture considerations:
   - Add logging at appropriate architectural boundaries
   - Inject loggers following dependency inversion
   - Keep domain layer pure (logging as cross-cutting concern)
   - Use domain events for significant state changes

4. DevOps best practices:
   - Ensure logs are machine-parseable
   - Include correlation IDs for distributed tracing
   - Log performance metrics at key points
   - Support structured logging for easier analytics

5. Security considerations:
   - Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
   - Log security-relevant events (authentication, authorization)
   - Include sufficient context for audit trails
