# My Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This repository contains the configuration files for the tools I use on a daily basis, along with scripts to set up a development environment quickly and efficiently. The goal of this setup is to make a new PC or environment ready for use with minimal effort, while keeping everything lightweight, optimized, and customizable.

## Why Use Dotfiles?

Dotfiles are the hidden configuration files that define the behavior of various command-line tools and applications. By keeping these in version control, I can:

- **Ensure Consistency**: Quickly apply the same configurations across multiple machines.
- **Improve Productivity**: Optimize my workflow with custom keybindings, aliases, and settings.
- **Easy Setup**: With just a few commands, I can configure a new environment or restore an existing one.

## Philosophy

- **Simple and Efficient**: The setup is designed to be straightforward, focusing on functionality without excessive complexity.
- **Minimal but Powerful**: Each tool and setting is chosen for its utility. I only use what's necessary to keep the system light yet effective.
- **Customizable**: Every aspect of the configuration is modular, making it easy to extend or modify based on individual preferences.

## What's Included

This repository contains configuration files for the following tools:

1. [**Tmux**](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)

4. **Zsh**  
   My Zsh is customized with the [Starship](https://starship.rs/guide/) prompt for a fast, minimal, and highly configurable prompt

5. **Setup Scripts**  
   A collection of scripts to automate the installation and configuration of these tools. These scripts help provision a new PC as quickly as possible by installing essential applications, setting up the environment, and applying dotfiles.
